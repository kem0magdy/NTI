Assig6: Write a program that calculates the required heater activation time according to the input temperature of water. <br />
- if the input temperature is from 0 to 30, then required 
heating time = 7 mins. <br />
- if the input temperature is from 30 to 60, then required 
heating time = 5 mins. <br />
- if the input temperature is from 60 to 90, then required 
heating time = 3 mins. <br />
- if the input temperature is more than 90, then required 
heating time = 1 mins. <br />
- if temperature is invalid, display "Invalid input" <br />
Example: <br />
Input = 10 -> output = 7 <br />
Input = 35 -> output = 5 <br />
