Assig6: Write a program that calculates the required heater activation time according to the input temperature of water.
- if the input temperature is from 0 to 30, then required
heating time = 7 mins.
- if the input temperature is from 30 to 60, then required
heating time = 5 mins.
- if the input temperature is from 60 to 90, then required
heating time = 3 mins.
- if the input temperature is more than 90, then required
heating time = 1 mins.
- if temperature is invalid, display "Invalid input"
Example:
Input = 10 -> output = 7
Input = 35 -> output = 5
