Assig1: Write a C Function that prints the cube of any number <br />
Assig2: Write a C Function that returns the addition or subtraction or multiplication or division for two numbers. The function should take the required operation and two numbers as arguments. It also should check that the input operation is one
of those operation that mentioned before and if not it should
return error. The function should be implemented using switch

Assig3: write a C Function that display Prime Numbers between Intervals (two numbers). <br />
Assig4:You are designing a poster which prints out numbers with a unique style applied to each of them. The styling is based on the number of closed paths or holes present in a giver number. The number of holes that each of the digits from 0 to 9 have
 are equal to the number of closed paths in the digit. Their
 values are: <br />
  1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 = 0 holes. <br />
 0, 4, 6, and 9 = 1 hole. <br />
 8 = 2 holes. <br /> 
Given a number, you must determine the sum of the number of
holes for all of its digits. For example, the number 819 has 3
holes. Make the function countHoles. The function must return
an integer denoting the total number of holes in num
